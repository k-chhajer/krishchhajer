WORK EXPERIENCE
Student Researcher
RBC Borealis — February 2025 - May 2025
- Developed a Reinforcement Learning agent with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using Stable Baselines3 for real-time microgrid management of Rye and Lac-Mégantic microgrids.
- Built comprehensive OpenAI Gym environments; achieved 100% user load satisfaction and maintained Island Mode (grid disconnected) over 70% of the time on the Rye dataset.
- Designed SOTA transformer-based forecasting models for renewable energy production; integrated them into a real-time dashboard via FastAPI, simulating 100K+ hourly timestamps to enable smarter grid decisions.

Machine Learning Researcher
Neural Engineering Lab — October 2024 - February 2025
- Developed and evaluated Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression models to predict systolic and diastolic blood pressure using Electro-Vascular Gram (EVG) signals.
- Applied window sampling and feature extraction (e.g., using catch22), achieving over 80% of predictions within 5 mmHg (aligned with British Health Society standards).
- Optimized a legacy Random Forest model: reduced tree count from 240 to 1 for efficiency and identified the top 3 predictive EVG features through analysis and tuning.

PROJECTS
AIM: Artificially Intelligent Maps
April 2025 — C++, Python, ezgl, LangChain, Flask
- Built a mapping application integrating OpenStreetMap data for real-time navigation and route planning across 19 cities.
- Implemented an LLM-powered agent (LangChain + OpenAI GPT-4o) via a Flask server for semantic retrieval of points of interest and intelligent route suggestions.
- Created a route optimization solver for TSP with VRP constraints using Greedy Regret Insertion and multithreaded local search (2-opt, 3-opt, 4-opt).

Fall Detection and Gait Patterns Analysis using Deep Learning
August 2024 — Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- Developed a CNN-LSTM model on tri-axial IMU data to detect human falls across 15 fall types and 20 ADL types, improving accuracy by 30%.
- Built a preprocessing pipeline with 2s window sampling at 50% overlap, extracting 56 statistical and spectral features.
- Conducted extensive architecture/hyperparameter search, achieving 99% training accuracy on SisFall, >80% validation on phone-collected data, and 92% test accuracy on MobiFall/MobiAct.

Pacman on FPGA
November 2024 — Verilog, Intel Quartus Prime, ModelSim
- Designed and implemented an interactive Pacman game in Verilog on the DE1-SoC.
- Integrated external I/O: 60Hz VGA display, keyboard controls (4 directions), and audio feedback via speakers.
- Engineered core game logic with finite state machines and sequential logic to control Pacman and two ghosts in a maze, including live video/audio and user input.
